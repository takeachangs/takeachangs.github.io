Our digital lives need the same intentional curation as our physical spaces.

Over the next seven days, we'll systematically examine every digital touchpoint in our lives—from apps and subscriptions to bookmarks and browser tabs.

**Day 1-2: Audit**
- List all apps on your devices
- Note which ones you actually use vs. which ones just exist
- Identify notification sources and their necessity

**Day 3-4: Eliminate**
- Delete unused apps
- Unsubscribe from newsletters that don't add value
- Clear browser bookmarks you haven't visited in months

**Day 5-6: Organize**
- Arrange remaining apps by purpose, not convenience
- Create focused digital workspaces
- Set boundaries around entertainment vs. productivity tools

**Day 7: Reflect**
- Notice how reduced digital clutter affects your mental clarity
- Establish maintenance routines to prevent re-accumulation

The goal isn't to live like a digital monk, but to ensure every pixel on your screen serves your actual goals, not just your impulses.
