Our digital lives need the same intentional curation as our physical spaces.

Over the next seven days, we'll systematically examine every digital touchpoint in our livesâ€”from apps and subscriptions to bookmarks and browser tabs.

**Day 1-2: Audit**
- List all apps on your devices
- Note which ones you actually use vs. which ones just exist
- Identify notification sources and their necessity

**Day 3-4: Eliminate**
- Delete unused apps
- Unsubscribe from newsletters that don't add value
- Clear browser bookmarks you haven't visited in months

**Day 5-6: Organize**
- Arrange remaining apps by purpose, not convenience
- Create focused digital workspaces
- Set boundaries around entertainment vs. productivity tools

**Day 7: Reflect**
- Notice how reduced digital clutter affects your mental clarity
- Establish maintenance routines to prevent re-accumulation

The goal isn't to live like a digital monk, but to ensure every pixel on your screen serves your actual goals, not just your impulses.
