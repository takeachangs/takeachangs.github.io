A capsule wardrobe isn't about having fewer clothes—it's about having the right clothes.

After years of closets stuffed with options I never wore, I reduced my wardrobe to 30 pieces. The result wasn't restriction—it was liberation.

**What changed:**

- **Decision fatigue disappeared**: Every piece works with everything else
- **Quality improved**: Fewer items meant I could invest in better materials
- **Style became consistent**: My aesthetic emerged when the noise was removed
- **Shopping became intentional**: New purchases had to earn their place

**The capsule framework:**

1. **Choose a color palette** (I use black, white, gray, and one accent)
2. **Define your lifestyle** (office, casual, travel ratios)
3. **Invest in foundations** (well-fitting basics in quality fabrics)
4. **Add personality** (a few pieces that feel uniquely you)

The magic isn't in the number—it's in the curation. When everything in your closet serves a purpose and brings you joy, getting dressed becomes effortless.

More importantly, you stop thinking about clothes and start thinking about everything else. That mental energy you used to spend on "I have nothing to wear" can now go toward things that actually matter.
